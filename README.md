# Gpx-router
App that uses the brouter backend to have a predefined profile used on the go. For use in ultra-races where un-the-go navigation is necessary.

## How to use
- tweak the profile.brf file to your needs
- hit the upload profile button so it gets stored in the brouter server cache (will be automated)
- enter coordinates where you want to Navigate
- export GPX

## TODO
- [ ] Add Status bar that shows the upload 
- [ ] Automate uploading of the profile
- [ ] Allow the use of the location as starting coords
- [ ] Tweak profile for ultraracing
- [ ] Add some styling to make it mobile friendly
